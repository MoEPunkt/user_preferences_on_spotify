Welcome to the GitHub Repository for the Data Science Project "(International) User Preferences on Spotify".
Here, you find all the relevant datasets and R-Scripts that we used for developing the application.

The scripts server.R, ui.R and global.R are the scripts that set up the application. They have to be located in the same repository to ensure that they interact properly.

All the other scripts are to be executed according to their enumeration and deliver the fundament of the application.
